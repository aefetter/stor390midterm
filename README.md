Midterm paper on Fake News Detectors for STOR390: Moral Machine Learning at UNC

I summarized the paper [Advancing Fake News Detection: Hybrid Deep Learning With FastText and Explainable AI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477989) and expanded to include ethical concerns of fake news detectors for my STOR390 midterm. This study builds upon existing fake news detection methods by combining traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models with FastText embeddings. Using explainable AI techniques, the project also addresses the ethical implications of misinformation detection by showing what words trigger news to be classified as fake in the training set. I discuss how the development and implementation of fake news detectors must consider the risks of both free speech absolutism and censorship.
